### Activities

#### Analysis

The Analysis tab contains the input entities in reports. Reports are central to OpenCTI as knowledge on threats and events. They allow for easier identification of the source of information by analysts. Additionally, analysts can add their investigation notes and other external resources for knowledge enrichment.

##### Events

Security analysts investigate and hunt for events involving suspicious and malicious activities across their organisational network. Within the Events tab, analysts can record their findings and enrich their threat intel by creating associations for their incidents.

#### Observations

Technical elements, detection rules and artefacts identified during a cyber attack. These elements assist analysts in mapping out threat events during a hunt and perform correlations between what they observe in their environments against the intel feeds.

### Knowledge

##### Threats

All information classified as threatening to an organisation or information would be classified under threats. These will include:

- **Threat Actors:** <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">An individual or group of attackers</span> seeking to propagate malicious actions against a target.
- **Intrusion Sets:** <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">An array of TTPs, tools, malware and infrastructure used by a threat actor </span>against targets who share some attributes. APTs and threat groups are listed under this category on the platform due to their known pattern of actions.
- **Campaigns:** <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">Series of attacks taking place within a given period and against specific victims</span> initiated by advanced persistent threat actors who employ various TTPs. Campaigns usually have specified objectives and are orchestrated by threat actors from a nation-state, crime syndicate or other disreputable organisation.

##### Arsenal

This tab lists all items related to an attack and any legitimate tools identified from the entities.

- **Malware:** Known and <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">active malware and trojan are listed with details of their identification </span>and mapping based on the knowledge ingested into the platform. In our example, we analyse the **4H RAT** malware and we can extract information and associations made about the malware.
- **Attack Patterns:** <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">Adversaries implement and use different TTPs to target, compromise, and achieve their objectives.</span> Here, we can look at the details of the **Command-Line Interface and make decisions based on the relationships established on the platform and navigate through an investigation associated with the technique.**
- **Courses of Action:** <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">MITRE maps out concepts and technologies that can be used to prevent an attack</span> technique from being employed successfully. These are represented as Courses of Action (CoA) against the TTPs.
- **Tools:** <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">Lists all legitimate tools and services developed for network maintenance, monitoring and management.</span> Adversaries may also use these tools to achieve their objectives. For example, for the Command-Line Interface attack pattern, it is possible to narrow down that **CMD** would be used as an execution tool. As an analyst, one can investigate reports and instances associated with the use of the tool.
- **Vulnerabilities:** <span style="color:rgb(221, 85, 85)">Known software bugs, system weaknesses and exposures are listed </span>to provide enrichment for what attackers may use to exploit and gain access to systems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list maintained by MITRE is used and imported via a connector.

#### Entities

This tab categorises all entities based on operational sectors, countries, organisations and individuals. This information allows for knowledge enrichment on attacks, organisations or intrusion sets.
