The scenario can be that the victim provides a “product”, for example, computing resources & bandwidth as a zombie in a botnet for crypto mining (producing new cryptocurrencies by solving cryptographic equations through the use of computers) purposes, while the adversary consumes their product or gets financial gain.

### Technology Component

**Technology** – the technology meta-feature or component highlights the ==relationship between the core features: capability and infrastructure.== The capability and infrastructure describe how the adversary operates and communicates.
