## Levels of the Pyramid:

1. [[1 Hash Values (Trivial)|Hash Values]]
    - **Description**: Unique identifiers for specific files or pieces of data.
    - **Difficulty**: Low. These can be easily obtained and matched against known malicious files.
    - **Impact**: Low. Attackers can easily change files to avoid detection.
2. [[2 IP Address (Easy)|IP Address]]
    - **Description**: Numerical labels as signed to devices connected to a network.
    - **Difficulty**: Low. IP addresses can be easily identified and blocked.
    - **Impact**: Low. Attackers can switch IP addresses to evade detection.
4. [[3 Domain Names (Simple)|Domain Names]]
    - **Description**: Names used to identify and access websites.
    - **Difficulty**: Low. Domains can be easily listed and blocked.
    - **Impact**: Low. Attackers can frequently change domains.
5. [[4 Host Artifacts (Annoying)|Network/Host Artifacts]]
    - **Description**: Evidence left on the network or host systems, such as log entries or configuration changes.
    - **Difficulty**: Moderate. Requires monitoring and analyzing network and host data.
    - **Impact**: Moderate. Attackers need to change their tools or techniques to avoid leaving artifacts.
6. [[5 Tools (Challenging)|Tools]]
    - **Description**: Software or scripts used by attackers to perform their actions.
    - **Difficulty**: Moderate. Identifying and blocking tools requires deeper analysis.
    - **Impact**: Moderate. Attackers need to find or develop new tools to continue their operations.
8. [[6 TTPs (Tough)|Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)]]
    - **Description**: The methods and patterns used by attackers to achieve their objectives.
    - **Difficulty**: High. Understanding TTPs requires comprehensive threat intelligence and analysis.
    - **Impact**: High. Attackers must significantly alter their behavior and approach to evade detection when their TTPs are understood and countered.

## Summary

The Pyramid of Pain highlights that while low-level indicators (like hash values and IP addresses) are easier to detect and block, they are also easier for attackers to change. Higher-level indicators (like TTPs) are more challenging to identify but provide more effective and long-lasting defense capabilities when understood and mitigated.
