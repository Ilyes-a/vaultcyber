It is really easy to spot a malicious file if we have the hash in our arsenal.Â  However, as an attacker, modifying a file by ==even a single bit is trivial==, which would produce a different hash value. With ***so many variations and instances of known malware or ransomware***, threat hunting using file hashes as the IOC (Indicators of Compromise) can become difficult.
