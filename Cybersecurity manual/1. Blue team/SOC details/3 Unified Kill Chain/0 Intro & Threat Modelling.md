# Threat Modelling

Threat modelling, in a cybersecurity context, is a series of steps to ultimately improve the security of a system. Threat modelling is about identifying risk and essentially boils down to:

- Identify critical systems and applications, noting their roles and whether they hold sensitive information.
- Assess vulnerabilities and potential exploits for these systems and applications.
- Develop a plan to secure these systems and applications against identified vulnerabilities.
- Implement policies to prevent future vulnerabilities, such as SDLC processes or employee training on phishing awareness.

Threat modelling is an important procedure in reducing the risk within a system or application, as it creates a high-level overview of an organisation's IT assets (_an asset in IT is a piece of software or hardware_) and the procedures to resolve vulnerabilities.

Ex Frameworks: STRIDE, DREAD and CVSS.

### Unified Kill Chain

UKC states that there are 18 phases to an attack:

- [[1 Phase In|Phase In]]
- [[2 Phase Through|Phase Through]]
- [[3 Phase Out|Phase Out]]
