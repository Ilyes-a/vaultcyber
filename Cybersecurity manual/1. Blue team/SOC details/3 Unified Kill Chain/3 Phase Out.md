### Collection [MITRE Tactic (TA0009)](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0009/)

The adversary gathers valuable data, compromising ==confidentiality==. Target sources include drives, browsers, audio, video, and email.

### Exfiltration ([MITRE Tactic TA0010](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0010/))

The adversary steals data, using encryption and compression to avoid detection. The C2 channel and tunnel from earlier phases are used.

### Impact ([MITRE Tactic TA0040](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0040/))

To compromise data ==integrity and availability==, the adversary may manipulate, interrupt, or destroy assets, disrupting business operations. This may involve account removal, disk wipes, ransomware, defacement, and DoS attacks.

### Objectives

The adversary seeks to achieve their strategic goal, such as encrypting files for ransom or releasing private information to damage the business's reputation.
