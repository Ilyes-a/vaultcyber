# MITRE 

"_At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation._"

**Projects/research** that the US-based non-profit MITRE Corporation has created:

- ATT&CK_®_ (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
- CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
- ENGAGE (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
- D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
- AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

## Basic Terminology

APT is an acronym for ==Advanced Persistent Threat==. This can be considered a team/group (**_threat group_**), or even country (**_nation-state group_**), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries. 

"The term 'advanced' can be misleading as it will tend to cause us to believe that each APT group all have some super-weapon, e.i. a zero-day exploit, that they use. That is not the case."

As we will see a bit later, the techniques these APT groups use are quite common and can be detected with the right implementations in place. You can view FireEye's current list of APT groups [**here**](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html).

TTP is an acronym for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, but what does each of these terms mean?

- The Tactic is the adversary's goal or objective.
- The Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
- The Procedure is how the technique is executed.
