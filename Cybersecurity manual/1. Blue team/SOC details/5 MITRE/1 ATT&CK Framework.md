# ATT&CK

According to the [website](https://attack.mitre.org/), "MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations."

In 2013, MITRE documented common TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) that APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups used against enterprise Windows networks. This started with an internal project known as FMX (Fort Meade Experiment).

The categories in the  ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise cover the seven-stage Cyber Attack Lifecycle. There are 14 categories. Each category contains the techniques an adversary could use to perform the tactic.

MITRE ATT&CK® Navigator: "_The ATT&CK® Navigator is designed to provide basic navigation and annotation of ATT&CK® matrices, something that people are already doing today in tools like Excel. We've designed it to be simple and generic - you can use the Navigator to visualize your defensive coverage, your red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques, or anything else you want to do_."
