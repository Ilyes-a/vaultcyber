# Weaponization

- In Weaponization stage, An attacker would craft a "weapon of destruction".
- The attack would prefer not to interact with the victim directly and, instead, he will create a "weaponizer" that, according to Lockheed Martin, combines **malware** and **exploit** into a deliverable **payload**. 
- Most attackers usually use automated tools to generate the malware or refer to the [DarkWeb](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/deep-web) to purchase the malware. 
- More sophisticated actors or nation-sponsored APT (Advanced Persistent Threat Groups) would write their custom malware to make the malware sample unique and evade detection on the target.

## Terminologies:

**Malware** is a program or software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer.

An **exploit** is a program or a code that takes advantage of the vulnerability or flaw in the application or system.

A **payload** is a malicious code that the attacker runs on the system.
