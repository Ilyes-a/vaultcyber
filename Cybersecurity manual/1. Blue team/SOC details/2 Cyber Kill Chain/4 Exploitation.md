# Exploitation

1. To gain access to the system, an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability.
2. After gaining access to the system, the malicious actor could exploit software, system, or server-based vulnerabilities to escalate the privileges or move laterally through the network. 
3. According to [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/lateral-movement/), **lateral movement** refers to the techniques that a malicious actor uses after gaining initial access to the victim's machine to move deeper into a network to obtain sensitive data.

> [FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/what-is-a-zero-day-exploit.html) - The zero-day exploit or a zero-day vulnerability is an unknown exploit in the wild that exposes a vulnerability in software or hardware and can create complicated problems well before anyone realizes something is wrong. A zero-day exploit leaves NO opportunity for detection at the beginning.
